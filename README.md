Covid-19 Quick Response is a prototype design for an application targeting elderly who are at most risk from public shopping. The aim of the application is to provide then a way to advertise a request for items such as groceries where more able bodied users of the app can act upon these requests. This application also provides general statistics and knowledge of the ongoing pandemic.
